        Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Every day I learn. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

<h2>A Bit About Lorem Ipsum</h2>

<p>
    <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is a placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and
    publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
</p>

<p>
    There are a variety of Lorem Ipsum generators, like <a href="https://www.bobrosslipsum.com/">this one</a>.
Or just google around.
